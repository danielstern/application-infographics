  The library that needs no introduction. 
  
  It's a framework that binds DOM nodes to data points, essentially creating
  a declarative way of making charts / graphs / other infographics. It's also got a wide variety of helpers such as
  color scales, linear scales, etc. If you're creating infographics in HTML/JavaScript and not using D3, you're likely
  reinventing the wheel.
